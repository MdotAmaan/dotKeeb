## Part list
Here are the parts used in this build, along with links to where I purchased them from. I'd encourage you to try and get as much stuff from local vendors if possible. Note that the quantities listed are for building 2 halves.

| Required | Quantity | Part                          | Notes                                                                            |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓        | 50       | **Kailh Choc V1 Switch**      |                                                                                  |
| ✓        | 50       | **Choc V1 Compatible Keycap** | I used MBK keycaps for my build. Other choc keycaps should also work             |
| ✓        | 50       | **Choc V1 Hotswap Socket**    | These are only required if you build using the hotswap model                     |
| ✓        | 50       | **THT Diode**                 |                                                                                  |
| ✓        | 2        | **nice!nano Microcontroller** |                                                                                  |
| ✓        | 2        | **>100mAh 3.7V LiPo Battery** | LiPo batteries are the recommended type of batteries for use with the nice!nanos. Li-ion batteries may work but you may run into issues with them|
| ✓        | 8        | **4mm M3 Heat-set Insert**    |                                                                                  |
| ✓        | 8        | **5mm M3 Screws**             |                                                                                  |
| ✓        | ~1.5m    | **Wire**                      | I used 24 AWG wire, but you can use whatever you are comfortable working with    |
| ⨯        | 2        | nice!view Display             | The displays aren't required for the keyboard to function |
| ⨯        | 2        | Power Switch                  | ZMK's sleep actually does a very good job of putting the keyboard to sleep and saving power, so these aren't necessary. However if you want to carry the keyboard in a bag or another place where accidental keypresses could occur, then a switch may be useful. |
| ⨯        | 12       | Small Rubber Feet             | These are to make sure the keybaord doenst slide around on your table, there are many other ways to acheive this too |

The total part cost can range anywhere between $150 to $200 depending on various factors.
