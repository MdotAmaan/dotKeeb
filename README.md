This is currently a work in progress.

## TODO for V2

- Even out edges and increase thickness
- Round off some of the corners
- Make sure chamfer angles are consistent
- OLED Module needs to be shifted up or angled away from switches (may be solved by added thickness)

- Consider making both rows of the thumb cluster planar to ease chording
- Add an additional slot in the left thumb-cluster for a 3x3 layout, with bottom right corner dedicated to a rotary encoder
- Remove key from right thumb-cluster to make space for a trackball socket
  - OR create separate trackball module that can slot into either half of the keyboard
- Use booleans to unite thumb-clusters with alphas instead.
- Change plate mounting holes
